Revision history for Perl extension Net::Amazon:

0.34 (07/11/2005)
   (ms) Added similar_asins() to Net::Amazon::Property
   (ms) Steven Alyari reported a caching problem on v5.8.1-RC3/darwin,
        where perl's hashes are stored differently between invocations
        of the same program, confusing Net::Amazon's URL-based caching
        algorithm. Applied his fix, which sorts the query arguments.

0.33 (02/23/2005)
   (ms) Makefile.PL prerequisite changed from undef to '0'.
   (ms) Greg McCann <greg@cambria.com> added ThirdPartyProductInfo.
   (ms) Added Exchange requests with help by Greg McCann <greg@cambria.com>.

0.32 (10/16/2004)
   (ms) Greg McCann <greg@cambria.com> added CollectiblePrice, 
        CollectibleCount, NumberOfOfferings, UsedCount, ThirdPartyNewPrice,
        ThirdPartyNewCount as default properties. To get (*Count, 
        NumberOfOfferings), specify "offer" => "All" in the request.

0.31 (09/22/2004)
   (ms) Lance P Cleveland <lance@lancecleveland.com> noticed that somewhere
        between 0.26 and 0.30 the properties() method lost the ability to 
        be called in scalar context and return only the first result. Added
        logic to re-enable it.

0.30 (09/14/2004)
   (ms) Lance Cleveland <lancec@proactivewm.com> provided a patch to
        fix a typo which caused N::A::Request::Similar to fail. Added more
        documentation on request classes and test cases for all constructors.

0.29 (08/12/2004)
   (ms) Brian <brianbrian@gmail.com> contributed code for querying sellers.
        Added docs and test cases. Added a new hierarchy N::A::Result/*
        to deal with responses containing results which aren't Amazon items.
   (ms) fixed bug in _convert_option: Override target option only if
        it doesn't exist already.

0.28 (08/04/2004)
   (ms) ASIN search can now process several asin numbers with one request.
        Dan Kreft <dan@kreft.net> cleaned up the implementation of 
        Request.pm, ASIN.pm and a bunch of other files.
   (ms) Tatsuhiko Miyagawa <miyagawa@livedoor.jp> provided a patch for
        load errors on search(blended => ...), a fix for a bug with
        single/multiple ProductLine(s), and a suggestion for using
        ForceArray which XML::Simple. Added test cases for this patch.
   (ms) Added xml_parse() method to Net::Amazon::Response which Net::Amazon
        now calls to parse the returned XML. This enables the response
        class (which can override it) to creatively interpret the 
        response XML to form the response data structure.
   (ms) Added strict warnings to each and every module
   (ms) Added dump_responses() for easier response canning.

0.27 (07/27/2004)
   (ms) Richard Giliam <nirosys@nirostasis.net> added the isbn()
        method to the Book.pm property.
   (ms) Andy Grundman <andy@hybridized.org> provided a patch to 
        enforce Amazon's no-more-than-1-request-per-second rule. 
        A new parameter 'strict' has been added to the Net::Amazon 
        constructor, which will limit the number of requests if 
        set to 1. Defaults to 1.

0.26 (07/07/2004)
   (ms) Added ProductDescription to Properties.pm
   (ms) Applied patch by Robert Rothenberg <wlkngowl@i-2000.com> for 
        Media and NumMedia properties.

0.25 (06/19/2004)
   (ms) Applied patch by Robert Rothenberg <wlkngowl@i-2000.com> to
        Properties.pm that returns the browse_nodes (categories) for 
        a result.
   (ms) Dave Holland <dave@biff.org.uk> suggested to provide access
        to the user agent's proxy settings. Now, proxy settings via
        environment variables are supported (env_proxy()) as well as
        passing Net::Amazon->new(); a prepped LWP::UserAgent instance
        via the 'ua' parameter (see docs).
   (ms) Accessors are no longer created in the constructors, but on the
        package level. Thanks to tony@tmtm.com who reported this to the
        CPAN bug tracker.
   
0.24 (06/10/2004)

        access TotalPages (now available as $resp->total_pages()).

0.21 (03/21/2004)
   (ms) Tatsuhiko Miyagawa <miyagawa@livedoor.jp> provided a patch to
        adapt N:A for Amazon's change of "locale=jp" requests, which 
        should be sent to xml.amazon.co.jp, instead of xml.amazon.com:
        http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=am-assocdevxml&msg=4629.1&ctx=4096

        multiple error messages returned by some requests to AMZN.
        There's two accessors now, Response->messages() returning

        returning them stringed together for backwards compatibility.
   (ms) Padraic Renaghan <padraic@renaghan.com> provided a patch
        for access to upc/media/nummedia fields in Music.pm
   (ms) Fixed test suite warnings with perl 5.8.2 in N::A::Property::Book.

0.17 (11/18/2003)
   (ms) Robert Graff <rgraff@workingdemo.com> provided a patch for 
        'blended' searches.

0.16 (10/10/2003)
   (ms) Replaced 'legacy call' onca/xml2 by onca/xml3, according to 
        the AWS newsletter.
   (ms) Martin Streicher <martin.streicher@apress.com> enhanced the
        "power" search script (in /eg) to limit searches to page
        ranges if so requested.

        for responses. Added a Cache::File-based implementation.

0.13 (08/07/2003)
   (ms) Added customer reviews for all properties. Changed default
        request mode to 'heavy' for that. Now all properties have a
        review_set() method returning a
        Net::Amazon::Attribute::ReviewSet object, which in turn offers
        a reviews() method delivering a list of
        Net::Amazon::Attribute::Review objects. Check the man pages
        for details. eg/review shows an example.

0.12 (07/24/2003)
   (ms) Mike Evron <evronm@dtcinc.net> noticed that the SYNOPSIS code
        on the main documentation page had the wrong "search" syntax 
        -- thanks, Mike!
   (ms) Changed all tests to process canned data, live tests turned out
        to be too unreliable, due to Amazon's "best effort" responses.
        If you want the test suite to process live data, you need to
        set the environment variable NET_AMAZON_LIVE_TESTS.
        
0.11 (07/14/2003)
   (ms) Added 'Similar Searches' API
   (ms) Adapted for new amazon.de and amazon.co.uk searches

0.10 (06/28/2003)
   (ms) Adapted wishlist test case for change in AMZN's catalog
   (ms) Added docs for new Net::Amazon homepage at net-amazon.sourceforge.net
        and mailing list
   (ms) Helper in place to assist XML::Simple in choosing the right parser,
        to avoid install problems due to XML::SAX::RTF.

0.09 (06/24/2003)
   (ms) Tony Bowden <tony@kasei.com> suggested to have a $ua->search
        method, abstracting the usage of the different request objects.
        Implemented that.
   (ms) Resolved warnings and strict errors in test cases

0.08 (06/22/2003)
   (ms) Changed dependencies to 5.006, XML::Simple and LWP::UserAgent

0.07 (06/10/2003)
   (ms) fixed bug with single-item-wishlists
   (ms) Lists printed as strings now have numbered bullets
   (ms) Tests are using new wishlist 1XL5DWOUFMFVJ (Net::Amazon)
   (ms) Added tests with canned reponses

0.06 (06/07/2003)
   (ms) applied workaround for AMZN's wishlist bug: If a wishlist
     is longer than 10 items, AMZN returns the first 10 items with
     no indication if there's any followup pages. The workaround
     just tries to fetch another batch in case there's exactly 10 and 
     hides eventually encountered errors. 

   Dan Sully <daniel@electricrain.com> provided a patch
     to suppress a warning in case a music item isn't returning a 'year'
     field

   Barnaby Claydon <bclaydon@perseus.com> reported a couple of problems
   with wishlists, they're fixed by the following patches:

   (ms) Added new property Net::Amazon::Property::DVD

   (ms) Changed as_string() of default Net::Amazon::Property (used if
     we come across a 'Toy' or 'Video Game' category) to return
     a more human-readable format.

   (ms) Implemented retry strategy on Amazon's temporary errors, if we
     encounter one, we'll sleep for 1 sec and then retry at most
     twice.

   (ms) Accessors have been changed to return an empty string if 
     a value hasn't been specified in XML. Products without price and
     other anomalies won't cause perl warnings anymore.

0.05 (05/31/2003)
   Martha Greenberg <marthag@mit.edu> provided bug reports 
   and patches for
       * 'music' parameter for UPC searches (fixed in doc)
       * Net::Amazon::Property::Music now deals correctly with
         CDs by multiple artists.
       * missing documentation of 'locale' parameter

   (ms) Net::Amazon now takes the 'locale' parameter also in
   the main Net::Amazon object's constructor.

0.04 (05/29/2003)
   Dan Sully <daniel@electricrain.com> provided a patch
   to check if a response indeed contains the {Details} hash.

0.03 (05/06/2003)
   (ms) properties returns empty list on failure now

   Martha Greenberg <marthag@mit.edu> provided patch for 
       * the now mandatory associates-id in the query
       * two documentation bugs

       identical patch to the problem :).
