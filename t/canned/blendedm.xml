      <ProductDescription>Since the earliest days of Internet scripting, Web developers have considered &lt;I>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide&lt;/I> an essential resource. David Flanagan's approach, which combines tutorials and examples with easy-to-use syntax guides and object references, suits the typical programmer's requirements nicely. The brand-new fourth edition of Flanagan's "Rhino Book" includes coverage of JavaScript 1.5, JScript 5.5, ECMAScript 3, and the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 standard from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Interestingly, the author has shifted away from specifying--as he did in earlier editions--what browsers support each bit of the language. Rather than say Netscape 3.0 supports the Image object while Internet Explorer 3.0 does not, he specifies that JavaScript 1.1 and JScript 3.0 support Image. More usefully, he specifies the contents of independent standards like ECMAScript, which encourages scripters to write applications for these standards and browser vendors to support them. As Flanagan says, JavaScript and its related subjects are very complex in their pure forms. It's impossible to keep track of the differences among half a dozen vendors' generally similar implementations. Nonetheless, a lot of examples make reference to specific browsers' capabilities.&lt;p>  Though he does not cover server-side APIs, Flanagan has chosen to separate coverage of core JavaScript (all the keywords, general syntax, and utility objects like Array) from coverage of client-side JavaScript (which includes objects, like History and Event, that have to do with Web browsers and users' interactions with them. This approach makes this book useful to people using JavaScript for applications other than Web pages. By the way, the other classic JavaScript text--Danny Goodman's &lt;I>JavaScript Bible&lt;/I>--isn't as current as this book, but it's still a fantastic (and perhaps somewhat more novice-friendly) guide to the JavaScript language and its capabilities. &lt;I>--David Wall&lt;/I>&lt;p>  &lt;B>Topics covered:&lt;/B> The JavaScript language (version 1.0 through version 1.5) and its relatives, JScript and ECMAScript, as well as the W3C DOM standards they're often used to manipulate. Tutorial sections show how to program in JavaScript, while reference sections summarize syntax and options while providing copious code examples.</ProductDescription>

            <Summary>Definitive is the word I would use.</Summary>
            <Comment>I have tried several books on Javascritping and while they all seem to have the same format of learning, this book draws from a different line of thought, make it simple and you can learn. This book may just be the definitive guide to learning Javascritping.&lt;P> &lt;P>Starting off this 750 plus page book is the explanation how JavaScript works from the client side and then from the server side of the things. This understanding is crucial to making sure your code is set up properly and that is works correctly the first time.&lt;P> &lt;P>Other topics covered in the book include data types, values, variables, expressions, operators, functions, objects and arrays. All of these topics are detailed yet simplified so even I could understand the nature of the text.&lt;P> &lt;P>Moving on you'll also cover how to setup windows, frames, DOM, events, forms, DHTML, cookies and security. All this is coupled with actual code screen shots to show you what the final outcome should look like.&lt;P> &lt;P>The author's ability to break down each topic and show you what you need to know in order to write the best possible code is the basis of this book. Overall this book is one to have and use on a constant basis.</Comment>

            <Summary>Best reference on JavaScript I have ever seen</Summary>
            <Comment>I have read many books on JavaScript before but this is by far the most comprehansive guide to the scripting language. This book is not for beginners. &lt;BR>I use it as a reference guide. If you know the object's name or the method's name on either client side or server side, you can just look it up in this book's index section and it will reference you to a particular page with detailed explonations and more often then not with examples. &lt;BR>Absolutely love this book</Comment>

            <Summary>Must have for learning and reference</Summary>
            <Comment>As a long time C++ programmer, I found this book to be neither too hard or too easy. Readers with no programming experience at all might have a harder time with the text, but if you have any kind of programming background, the text will serve you well. As a reference, the text is second to none. Even the DOM reference is one of the best out there.</Comment>

            <Summary>Not really for absolute beginners</Summary>
            <Comment>This book calls itself "Learning Perl," apparently because it is geared towards beginners. However, upon reading more and more of this book, it becomes increasingly clear that this book is not at all a learning tool, as it is a good reference for those who already learned the basics of Perl. The first chapter should be skipped over entirely if you're a beginner, because it will do nothing more than confuse you and turn you off to Perl. The subsequent chapters covers all relevant topics, but they skimp on providing descriptive key examples which would help you to better understand the concept. This book makes too many references to C and other languages, implying that you already know previous programming languages. The chapter on regular expressions is shamefully cursory and lacking in examples which can be adequately picked up by the Perl novice. The language of the text is not for the beginner user, as it throws around too many Perl-centric terms and definitions. For an intermediate, this may be sufficient, but it will not do for the beginner. I recommend Perl for Dummies as the ultimate beginner's tool. That book doesn't cover as many topics as this book, but it certainly explains conceps in a much more novice-friendly language than Learning Perl. Learning Perl makes the mistake of not keeping it simple. This is a very important teaching idea, when your expected audience are complete novices who need to have everything explained to them in basic layman's terms. This book is more of a sophisticated primer for already skilled programmers.</Comment>

            <Comment>This is as good as it gets.&lt;P>The writing style is fun throughout, the chosen examples interesting, organization very well thought out, presentation clear. You pick it up and you will keep reading.&lt;P>The first chapter gives an overview of what the language can do via an example ("guess the secret word") which is developed more and more using more and more features of the language.&lt;P>In your average programming book the examples are tortured and boring so that it's hard to keep reading. Not so here.&lt;BR>Everything is well motivated and the writing style is amusing throughout.&lt;P>If you are coming from a system language background you will be hooked immediately. The ease with which many tasks are dealt with in Perl is astonishing.&lt;P>The amusing style and excellent presentation is kept up in all chapters of the book. The book will give you an overview of the language and basic skills. &lt;P>None of the programming books I have seen comes close to explaining basic constructs as clearly as this one. If this is your first book of first language you are very lucky.&lt;P>You will feel the need for an in depth presentation. This is not a criticism of the book. What's presented here is already very powerful.&lt;BR>Even after 2 days I was able to write a script doing some useful work I could not otherwise have accomplished. &lt;P>Perl is too rich to give an exhaustive treatment in 260 pages. You'll need Larry Wall's book also and this is clearly stated in the book.&lt;P>This book makes learning Perl fun and will create a lot of fans for the language. It's the perfect entry and will keep you strongly motivated to delve deeper.</Comment>

            <Summary>A great introduction</Summary>
            <Comment>This book is aimed at Perl novices and sys admins who need to get up to speed quickly. As with most O'Reilly books I found the authors know thier stuff and the book was well edited. &lt;P>The book contains enough info to allow you to script most sys admin tasks, and has the benefit of being short and therefore easy to carry, but once you get a taste of Perl's power you will no doubt want to get the "camel" (programming perl), which is more comprehensive.</Comment>

      <ProductDescription>Larry Wall wrote Perl and he wrote &lt;I>Programming Perl&lt;/I>. Better yet,  he writes amusingly and well--all of which comes across in this latest edition  of the definitive guide to the language.&lt;p>  Like Topsy, Perl just grew, and as a result the need for a third edition came  about. It's now over 1,000 pages, which it needs to be, as it performs several  different duties. First, it's an introduction to the Perl language for those who  are new to programming; also, it's a guide for those who are coming from other  languages; and, finally, it's a Perl language reference. &lt;p>  Among Larry Wall's other pursuits is being a linguist, and it's perhaps for this  reason that Perl is a peculiarly flexible language with many routes to achieving  the same ends, as the authors ably demonstrate. It's also extensible in several  ways, designed to work with many other languages. Also, as it's largely  interpreted, programs written in Perl tend to run unmodified on a variety of  platforms--although platform-specific Perl modules and programming practices are  also discussed.&lt;p>  A major strength of &lt;I>Programming Perl&lt;/I> is the way subject areas are  approached from several directions. This constant shift of viewpoint eliminates  blind spots in the reader's understanding and provides a pleasing echo of the  way Perl itself can take many routes from here to there. &lt;p>  Because the Perl community is both knowledgeable and active, the language covers  much more ground here than in the previous edition. Even if you have both  previous editions, you'll want this latest version--if only for the new jokes.  &lt;I>--Steve Patient, amazon.co.uk&lt;/I></ProductDescription>

            <Summary>Who said ....</Summary>
            <Comment>The book is definetely written for those who at least have some (or maybe a little more than just "some") programming background, and willing to learn Perl from the author of the language.&lt;P>I read the first edition of the book, which was about 200 pages, or something in that range, which filled my mind with nothing but questions. Current edition, however, could answer to all of those questions (well, almost). Of course, to make it answer them I had to re-read the book four times. But none of the books I currently own (and I own quite a few) could've taken me to the innards of the language so deep no matter how many times I had read them. So the book is of value. &lt;P>The Camel book, especially, does a great job on Regular Expressions and pattern matching. If you want to learn RegEx of perl in very details, you definitely need listen to the author of Perl. "Mastering Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Friedl is also a good choise, but doesn't include the latest updates.&lt;P>Formats aren't covered very well though. So you might consider "The Lama book" for that ("Learning Perl"). Still, none of the books can tell you about the innards of the Perl in so much detail overall than "Programming Perl".&lt;P>OOP is also toched upon in the book. Since purpose of the author is not to preach you OO lingo (but plain Perl), you'll treat that part just as an intorduction to OOP and consider "Object Oriented perl" by Damian Convey as the next text book. &lt;P>I found chpater 14, "Tied variables" very helpfull though. It might remind you of DBM/Berkley DB, through the syntax &lt;P>tie my %db, 'AnyDBM_File', 'my_file', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0664;&lt;P>but unfortunately it's not about DBM at all. It is about how the "tie" function works, and teaches you how to create your own classes for implementing with "tie". After that chapter, I even had to update some of my classes and saved lots of time for their updates. &lt;P>"Compiling", chapter 18 ,is a must read chapter for those who "live &amp; breath" with Perl (like me, may be ?).&lt;P>I don't want you to buy the book unless you have a good understanding of Programming or/and have knowledge of some programming languages. Otherwise, it won't help at all. &lt;P>If your purpose is just to get started with Web applications, go for "CGI progamming 101" by Jacqueline Hamilton. It is a good start. But if you want to go even deeper, "Learning Perl" and "Perl Coookbook" is the next choise. Keep the "The Camel" book as the next (but definitely, not the last).</Comment>

            <Summary>Its the reference, but don't use it for learning</Summary>
            <Comment>Unless you happen to have a degree in Unix and programming (I haven't anyway), don't use this book to learn Perl beyond Randal's Llama book (Learning Perl, excellent!). Programming Perl is a complete reference of the language but is was not made for teaching you Perl. Advanced Perl like references (actually everything after chapter 4) is quite diffucult to understand in the way it was written. Yes, I read the Llama book first but this doesn't mean you will understand the Camel. I would recommend:&lt;P>more examples (and their outputs)&lt;BR> less focus on cool snippets (provide every day code)&lt;BR> less C and Unix (Perl is mutli platform, why refer to a Unix man page instead of explaining a function?)&lt;BR> try to find simple words to explain things.&lt;P>Not everyone is an advanced programmer but everyone should use Perl. Its a wonderful language.</Comment>

            <Summary>Good introduction</Summary>
            <Comment>This isn't the book for a first-time programmer. Outside of that, it's a great reference. Maybe the more advanced language features need more clarification, but it's plenty to get you going on your first few Perl programs.&lt;P>Perl is a pleasant oddity among programming langauges. It has lots of features that make it great as a "glue" language, for holding other programs together and for doing those irksome little translations between incompatible formats. Those are the things that shell scripts used to do: setting up files, command lines, and environment variables, checking results, preparing reports. Perl does all that, better, and gives you the full power of a programming language on top of it all. That means the transformations aren't at the mercy of available filters, and don't count on the dozen different syntaxes of the dozen different filter programs. It's a great language for all those little one-off tasks that crop up, especially in system and web admin.&lt;P>That's my problem with Perl, though - the free-wheeling, never-look-back, whatever-works spirit of the people who use Perl. I know there are disciplined, competent software engineers who develop and use Perl, and I don't mean to disparage them at all. Still, the gonzo style that's so common and the revival tent spirit of books like this put me off a bit.&lt;P>The language is very useful, and make lots of hard jobs easy. This book, despite its true-believer style, gives a thorough introduction to the language and its core APIs.</Comment>

            <Summary>Unbeatable.</Summary>
            <Comment>This little radio is simply amazing. I got it for motorcycle touring, where space is at a premium, so I could have tunes in hotels and campsites. The radio is tiny, the sound quality is just great. It's a little odd getting used to mono, but any further away than a few feet, the difference is not noticable. Combined with my iPod, this is pretty much the perfect sound system for travelling. It's pricey, but it's worth every penny.</Comment>

            <Summary>Superb for distributing XM Satellite Radio in my house</Summary>
            <Comment>First, I agree with the prior reviewers that the sound quality is almost unbelievably good for a unit this size. &lt;P>I now own 27 (yes, 27!) of these, and use them to distribute XM throughout my house as follows: Delphi XM receiver to Sangean FM transmitter (from ccrane-dot-com) to Tivoli PAL. Prior to hearing the PAL, I wouldn't have thought a small monaural unit would provide acceptable sound in a small room; the PAL does.&lt;P>The FM tuner had excellent sensitivity (ability to pick up weak stations), yet many radios do. What sets the PAL apart is its exceptional selectivity (ability to receive a realtively weak station that is wedged between two nearby, and stronger, stations).&lt;P>And, for what its worth, when I dropped one into a swimming pool, it floated.</Comment>

            <Summary>the best gift for anyone at any age!</Summary>
            <Comment>You could say between my fiance and myself we've started a collection of the PAL radios, we own three so far, a black, blue and yellow and I'm trying to decide between the Red or Green for my next purchase. These radios are fantastic and reliable and are great for gifts! &lt;BR>The size of this radio was what appealed to me but only after I had it at home and realized all the places it fit. the radio has such a small footprint that it fit in the corner of my bathtub, and sits on my windowsill while I wash dishes. My fiance has one that he leaves plugged in the wall which always keeps his battery fully recharged at all times. The reception has always been reliable on both AM and FM and I can always count on my PAL for the Red Sox games while in the yard with the dog. &lt;BR>I've given close to ten of these radios away within the last two years and everyone loves them! You get your choice between eight different colors which appeals to even the youngest recipient who was nine and was ecstatic about owning her very own RED "grown up radio" she took it outside with her often and her favorite station she listened to was Radio Disney. For convenience this radio can be ordered directly from www.tivoliaudio.com and will ship directly to the gift recipient if you choose. I can't say enough about these radios only that if you don't own one you're missing out!&lt;BR>Kudos Tivoli Audio!</Comment>

            <Comment>As a college student specializing in digtal photography, I know what I'm talking about. This paper is absolutely wonderful for printing REAL photo quality pictures. As long as you have a good printer, a color cartridge, and are sure to make the necessary adjustments in your print settings, you will never back to those cheaper poor-quality photo papers!!!!</Comment>

            <Summary>ILFORD Smooth Pearl</Summary>
            <Comment>When I first started developing my own black and white prints almost 30 years ago I fell in love with Ilford pearl. More recently I switched to digital imaging and Ilford Smooth Pearl provides the same beautiful paper finish for ink jet printers that they provided for film developers. The paper has a great look and feel and is reistant to fading. It has the feel of a high quality traditional photo paper. It also works with encapsulated pigmented inks as well as dye based inks. It drys instantly and because of its luster type surface is resistant to smudge marks and finger prints. Ilford also offers a classic version of Pearl, but it is not usable with pigmented inks. I am using Ilford Smooth Pearl with my Epson Stylus 2200 with great results.</Comment>

            <Summary>Beautiful early opera</Summary>
            <Comment>Il Zazzerino (with works spanning 1577 to 1609) is mostly from the early music era "La Nuove Musiche" or the New Music, by Italian composer and tenor, Jacopo Peri, who wrote the first operas, Dafne (1598) and Euridice (1600). The music is luscious and warm, and Andrew Lawrence-King's harp is a beautiful counterpart to Ellen Hargis, who unfurls a sensitive but powerful expressive voice for each piece. Fans of early opera will be pleased by the recording.&lt;P>I discovered Il Zazzerino while looking for more work by Lawrence-King, after finding his work on the new recording of the first opera performed in the New World, by Spanish composer Torrejón y Velasco: La Púrpura de la rosa, which I also highly recommend. Another high quality early music opera.</Comment>

            <Summary>Sublime yet Sexy</Summary>
            <Comment>The clever marketing alone sold me on this CD. While the composer and instruments are not widely known outside Baroque enthusiasts, the target audience for this recording clearly reaches beyond those with a purely academic interest. This recording is exquisite. The performers are virtuosic, and, judging from the deeply personal liner notes, missionaries for this wonderful material. The virtuosic second movement of the Suite en Re will convince even the most hardened of sceptics that this is engaging material. I make a good deal of my living from classical, medieval and new music, but take a break and rarely play anything past the 14th century (on my home stereo) just for fun. However, I have been enjoying this CD at least twice daily all week and I am buying several more for gifts.</Comment>

            <Summary>Pretty good</Summary>
            <Comment>This game isn't anything like the games Il-2 Sturmovick, or Microsoft simulators, but this game is pretty fun. The only view is from high above your plane, but that is not to bad because there is a wide selection of aircraft. I know a lot about WWII, and let me tell you, the B-17 preforms like B-17 and a B-29 preforms like a B-29. This game is good if it's a rainy day and there is nothing to do. Buy this game!</Comment>

      <ProductDescription>The early-morning quiet is shattered by the eerie whine of dive-bombers. You're the lead gunner on deck as you attempt to defend against Zeroes, Kates, and Vals. Torpedoes rake the water, bombs scream all around, and steel meets steel as planes crash thunderously against ships. Sound effects put you viscerally in the thick of the action, and easy-to-use controls let you jump into combat right away. Three modes let you attack, defend, or evade.</ProductDescription>

            <Summary>Not for the serious game players</Summary>
            <Comment>If you are after a solid challenging game, then this is not for you. However, if you want something simple to waste time, then this game is ok.&lt;P>It is old style shooter where new things keep poping up and they get harder to hit as time moves on.&lt;P>Get the current patches! The graphics improve. However, there is still a system crash bug after the 20th level. There are also a couple bugs where there is a "magic portal" in the sky the planes use to reappear behind you. Annoying....&lt;P>Again, if you are an advanced game player you probably will not like this game.</Comment>

            <Summary>GREAT GAME ALERT!</Summary>
            <Comment>This is a superb game! Other reviewers hate it because of it's simple play. But that is an advantage to new computer users. It only uses about 8 number keys and your mouse. Nice graphics for the time it was made. Okay, So there are disadvantages like in the game there are kamakazies in 1941. But still, My dad's (who is not one for computers!) only computer game he likes is this, Pearl Harbor: Defend the Fleet. If your thinking of buying it, DO IT! DEFENINTLY!</Comment>

            <Summary>Where's the DVD????</Summary>
            <Comment>Sweet Valley High was one of the sharpest, most clever, and terribly underrated teen shows out there that unjustly got cancelled after four delightful seasons, and has not yet been released on DVD. While I wish the series would have concentrated more on serious issues, the tone of the series was light, fluffy, and fun with some seriousness thrown into the mix. &lt;P>Kidnapped was one of the more serious, but ludicrous, storylines from Season 1, edited as one episode for this video release. The first episode is like any other of Sweet Valley High; cute and harmless. Elizabeth volunteers at the hospital, where a famous talk show host is a patient. This grabs her twin sister Jessica's interest and she tries to sneak in to meet the man and nab a job as his new co-host. In order to do that, she has to pretend to be Elizabeth, with humorous results. On a more serious note, while at the hospital, a quiet orderly, Peter, becomes fascinated by Elizabeth and begins sending her gifts as a secret admirer. This pisses off her boyfriend, Todd, who thinks his best friend, Winston, is the one sending the gifts because he and Elizabeth have grown so close. This causes a rivalry between the friends and, in the second episode, makes Winston a suspect when Peter kidnaps Elizabeth. The third episode, the most ridiculous of the three, finds Peter, who escaped from the police car at the end of episode 2, kidnapping Jessica, who he thinks is Elizabeth. Episode 2 also introduces Nick, a charming rich transfer student who grabs Jessica and Lila's attention, and unknowingly comes between Todd and Elizabeth in the season finale, setting up Season 2.&lt;P>This is a fun video, but is definitely not the best of Season 1, which overall, is the best season of the series. The episodes are addicting, but rather far-fetched. The earlier episodes of the season are far superior and I can't wait till the seasons are released on DVD. It's long been delayed.</Comment>

      <ProductDescription>After viewing &lt;I>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/I>, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote to Walt Disney about adapting his novel of an ape-man into a feature animated cartoon. Sixtysome years later, the tale is finally told with brilliant design work that looks unlike any previous animated film. The story is a natural for Disney since the themes of misunderstood central figures have been at the heart of its recent hits. Disney's &lt;I>Tarzan&lt;/I> doesn't wander far from the familiar story of a shipwrecked baby who is brought up by apes in Africa. What gives the film its zing is its clever use of music (the songs are sung by Phil Collins himself rather than onscreen characters) and the remarkable animation. Deep Canvas, a 3-D technology, was developed for the film, creating a jungle that comes alive as Tarzan swings through the trees, often looking like a modern skateboarder racing down giant tree limbs. The usual foray of sidekicks, including a rambunctious ape voiced by Rosie O'Donnell, should keep the little ones aptly entertained. The two lead voices, Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan and Minnie Driver as Jane, are inspired choices. Their chemistry helps the story through the weakest points (the last third) and makes Tarzan's initial connection with all things human (including Jane) delicious entertainment. Disney still is not taking risks in its animated films, but as cookie-cutter entertainment, &lt;I>Tarzan&lt;/I> makes a pretty good treat. (Ages 5 and up) &lt;I>--Doug Thomas&lt;/I></ProductDescription>

            <Summary>great retelling of well-worn story</Summary>
            <Comment>I never have found out how many screen versions of 'Tarzan' Hollywood has put out over the years, but this version simply has to be one of the best. Inspired vocal casting, fantastic songs by Phil Collins(who won an oscar for his work), and some incredible animation make a very special film. It's solid from the beginning, showing Tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck, through their deaths at the hands of a leopard, to his discovery by and childhood with a lonely female gorilla, through his adolescence and bewilderment at being so diferent from everyone else. I ask you, who hasn't felt like a total outsider at some point in their life? Disney's animators captured that feeling flawlessly in this film. His happiness at finding others like himself, his joy in discovering what it is to be human, his love for Jane, and his real pain at choosing to be with her intsead of his adopted mother. What an emotional roller-coaster. The last third of the movie really picks up steam when a member of the human party takes over and tries to capture the animals to take back to London for money, and battles Tarzan in a climactic battle at the end. This film stands as one of the best produced by the Disney Studio, and I loved it the first time I saw it in theaters, and it was one I quickly added to my DVD collection. Watch, and enjoy!</Comment>

            <Summary>Disneyfication of Tarzan</Summary>
            <Comment>Disney gives _Tarzan_ the usual treatment. The result is for fans of the Disney formula only.&lt;P>Though touted as a faithful adaption of Burrough's novel this film bears little resemblence to that book. (Though it is perhaps slightly closer to the source material than the similarly touted _Greystoke_).&lt;P>Instead, Disney places the familiar character through the typical Disney paces: teaching lessons of tolerence and envornmentalism that sophisticated 9 year olds will find trite.&lt;P>The generic formula films that Disney produces work best when the music, comedy, and animation offer something for adults as well as children. In this case Disney is 1 out of 3. The animation is specacular. But the humor is generally weak--there are a few genuine laughs, most curtesy of Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's childhood ape friend--and the music by ex-Genesis lead singer/drummer Phil Collins is sleep inducingly dull.&lt;P>Still, kids seemed to like it so as a children's movie score this one as a success. But it's only recommended for adults who liked _Pocahontas_, _Mulan_, or _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. If you were hoping for another _Little Mermaid_ or _Beauty and the Beasts_ or even _Aladin_, skip this one.</Comment>

            <Comment>This is a great movie but its the kind that you can get a little tired of after a while. I didn't really care for Minnie Driver's voice for Jane Porter; it didn't fit somehow. And while the music in Trashin' the camp was differant from the rest of the soundtrack,it was refreshing and I thought it fit perfectly with the destruction of the camp.&lt;BR> Phil Collins did a superb job with the music. I got goosebumps on several parts,he's that good. His singing voice just seems to fit with the wild jungle setting. All in all,a good movie.</Comment>

            <Summary>A classic israeli film</Summary>
            <Comment>This is the next chapter in Gila Almagor's coming-of-age autobiography, begun in her film, THE SUMMER OF AVIYA. UNDER THE DOMIM TREE (or crab apple tree) continues the story five years later, in the mid-1950s, in Israel. Aviya, now 15, lives in a youth village for war orphans and teenagers from troubled homes, where she and her new friends stand in as family for one another. Aviya searches for clues to the identity of her deceased father, endures the unpredictability of her emotionally unstable mother, Henya (played by Gila Almagor herself) and is pursued by Polish-born fellow teenager, Jurek, who desperately tries to win her heart. By day Aviya and her friends laugh, play and study like other teens; by night memories of their unspeakable losses return. They find refuge together under the domim (crabapple) tree, where the story finds its surprising and exhilarating climax. Filmed in a Zionism-realism style.</Comment>

            <Comment>This is a great movie but its the kind that you can get a little tired of after a while. I didn't really care for Minnie Driver's voice for Jane Porter; it didn't fit somehow. And while the music in Trashin' the camp was differant from the rest of the soundtrack,it was refreshing and I thought it fit perfectly with the destruction of the camp.&lt;BR> Phil Collins did a superb job with the music. I got goosebumps on several parts,he's that good. His singing voice just seems to fit with the wild jungle setting. All in all,a good movie.</Comment>

      <ProductDescription>After viewing &lt;I>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/I>, Edgar Rice  Burroughs wrote to Walt Disney about adapting his novel of an ape-man into a feature animated cartoon. Sixtysome years later, the tale is finally told with brilliant design work that looks unlike any previous animated film. The story is a natural for Disney since the themes of misunderstood central figures have been at the heart of its recent hits. Disney's &lt;I>Tarzan&lt;/I> doesn't wander far from the familiar story of a shipwrecked baby who is brought up by apes in Africa. What gives the film its zing is its clever use of music (the songs are sung by Phil Collins himself rather than onscreen characters) and the remarkable animation. Deep Canvas, a 3-D technology, was developed for the film, creating a jungle that comes alive as Tarzan swings through the trees, often looking like a modern skateboarder racing down giant tree limbs. The usual foray of sidekicks, including a rambunctious ape voiced by Rosie O'Donnell, should keep the little ones aptly entertained. The two lead voices, Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan and Minnie Driver as Jane, are inspired choices. Their chemistry helps the story through the weakest points (the last third) and makes Tarzan's initial connection with all things human (including Jane) delicious entertainment. Disney still is not taking risks in its animated films, but as cookie-cutter entertainment, &lt;I>Tarzan&lt;/I> makes a pretty good treat. (Ages 5 and up) &lt;I>--Doug Thomas&lt;/I></ProductDescription>

            <Summary>great retelling of well-worn story</Summary>
            <Comment>I never have found out how many screen versions of 'Tarzan' Hollywood has put out over the years, but this version simply has to be one of the best. Inspired vocal casting, fantastic songs by Phil Collins(who won an oscar for his work), and some incredible animation make a very special film. It's solid from the beginning, showing Tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck, through their deaths at the hands of a leopard, to his discovery by and childhood with a lonely female gorilla, through his adolescence and bewilderment at being so diferent from everyone else. I ask you, who hasn't felt like a total outsider at some point in their life? Disney's animators captured that feeling flawlessly in this film. His happiness at finding others like himself, his joy in discovering what it is to be human, his love for Jane, and his real pain at choosing to be with her intsead of his adopted mother. What an emotional roller-coaster. The last third of the movie really picks up steam when a member of the human party takes over and tries to capture the animals to take back to London for money, and battles Tarzan in a climactic battle at the end. This film stands as one of the best produced by the Disney Studio, and I loved it the first time I saw it in theaters, and it was one I quickly added to my DVD collection. Watch, and enjoy!</Comment>

            <Summary>Disneyfication of Tarzan</Summary>
            <Comment>Disney gives _Tarzan_ the usual treatment. The result is for fans of the Disney formula only.&lt;P>Though touted as a faithful adaption of Burrough's novel this film bears little resemblence to that book. (Though it is perhaps slightly closer to the source material than the similarly touted _Greystoke_).&lt;P>Instead, Disney places the familiar character through the typical Disney paces: teaching lessons of tolerence and envornmentalism that sophisticated 9 year olds will find trite.&lt;P>The generic formula films that Disney produces work best when the music, comedy, and animation offer something for adults as well as children. In this case Disney is 1 out of 3. The animation is specacular. But the humor is generally weak--there are a few genuine laughs, most curtesy of Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's childhood ape friend--and the music by ex-Genesis lead singer/drummer Phil Collins is sleep inducingly dull.&lt;P>Still, kids seemed to like it so as a children's movie score this one as a success. But it's only recommended for adults who liked _Pocahontas_, _Mulan_, or _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. If you were hoping for another _Little Mermaid_ or _Beauty and the Beasts_ or even _Aladin_, skip this one.</Comment>

            <Summary>A moving love story....</Summary>
            <Comment>I kept waiting for this movie to make it to our local art theater but it never came. Luckily it has arrived on dvd and I have finally had the chance to see it. Barely over an hour long, this small love story delivers a punch and good performances from the lead actors. A bonus in the film is a lot of Israeli culture and insight into the life of young Israeli soldiers.&lt;P>The story centers around two soldiers, Yossi, a respected leader and Lior (or Jagger, as his friends call him, because of his rock star good looks and charisma). Because they are gay, their love is kept secret---a position Yossi is fine with and Jagger is tired of and wants changed. The two lovers sneak away when time permits and the love they share is warm and genuine. The chemistry between the two actors if believable and you find yourself hoping for the two to live "happily ever after". &lt;P>There is not much in the way of extra features on the dvd (there is a video of the song Jagger sings to Yossi after their bout in the snow) and a few previews of other Strand Releasing videos and dvds. But it is the film that is important and this one is well worth adding to your dvd library. I highly recommend this touching love story to anyone!</Comment>

            <Summary>Less is more</Summary>
            <Comment>This Israeli film clocks in at just a little over 1 hour but it manages to establish more character development than most films twice that length as well as displaying a complex array of human emotions. &lt;P>The story takes place in an army camp on a remote snowy mountaintop near the Lebanon border. Yossi, a commander, is in love with the cute and free spirited soldier Jagger. Yossi has a "don't ask, don't tell" view on their relationship while Jagger is much more open and wants to be able to rent a hotel room "with one bed, not two." The film deftly handles the intricies of their relationship but this is much more than a gay romance film. The dullness and claustrophobic conditions of army life is skillfully depicted with the help of a shaky camera that gives the film a documentary look.&lt;P>Secondary characters sustain interest also and include two female soldiers - one is having an affair with a married officer and the other has a crush on Jagger, despite the fact that almost everyone has told her that "you're not really his type." &lt;P>This film could probably have been more affecting with a little more time (the ending seems a little abrupt) but it still delivers quite a punch for such a small film.&lt;P>The only dvd extras are a music video which is a shame. It would have been nice to learn more about the filmmaker and the wonderful actors who appear in the film.</Comment>

            <Comment>I saw Yossi and Jagger @ a Jewish Film Festival. I wasn't sure what to expect!It was tender,funny, showed good insight into life during an Israeli tour of duty. The girls were great! I wish it could have been longer. I cried and cried at the ending.I searched and waited a year to buy this movie,I've watched it many times and highly reccomend it,it is one my favourite movies.Does anyone know the title of the song Rita sings? or who sings in the music video at the end? I'd prefer a hebrew version.</Comment>
